"log4.json": `Changes 4/23/2025

  "log.json": `Changes 4/20/2025
- Grenades can no longer be thrown after dying.
- Grenades now store their thrower's team, so persistent grenades (like incendiaries) shouldnâ€™t hurt teammates after you die.

- Added a new playable SCP to the roster.
- Anchored SCP-207's room.

- Unlocking mouse as spectator now defaults to showing spectate menu.
- Added more hair options for player customization.
- Added glasses to Scientist customization.
